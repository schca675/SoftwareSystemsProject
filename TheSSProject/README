------------------------------------------
Installation:

Import the Project into Eclipse.

To use the program and play a FourWins game, first the server needs to be setup and only afterwards the Client can connect.

Setup of the Server:
Run the server class. Then the program asks for a port number on the console.
Enter a valid port number (Integer between 1025 and 65535). The program will only continue once a valid port number is entered.
